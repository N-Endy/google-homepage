Recreating Google Homepage

page can be viewed on: https://n-endy.github.io/google-homepage/

This is my first project from TheOdinProject.
Objective was to create a look alike of the google home. I tried to do just that but encountered some problems

#Problems
I couldn't find a replica of the exact square grids used on the top right links, so a got a look alike from fontawesome.
I decide to use alphabets instead of an image for "Google". I couldn't find an exact font so used a different one. It allow me to use span to use in styling the different letters
I also couldn't place the search and microphone icons in such a way that the cursor starts from after the search icon.

#What I learnt
Before the project, i tried to learn flexbox, grid and media query, and I was able to apply them in this project.
I also used positioning for the icons placed on the search input.

My greatest joy from this project was that I was able to do everything on my own
